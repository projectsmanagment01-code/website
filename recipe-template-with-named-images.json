      "ingredient": "00 Flour",
      "note": "Italian 00 flour is finely ground and creates the most authentic crispy-chewy crust. All-purpose flour works as a substitute but won't be quite as tender."
    },
    {
      "ingredient": "Fresh Mozzarella",
      "note": "Use whole milk mozzarella (fior di latte) or buffalo mozzarella. Drain well and slice instead of shredding. Pre-shredded mozzarella contains anti-caking agents that prevent proper melting."

    {
      "ingredient": "San Marzano Tomatoes",
      "note": "These Italian tomatoes have the perfect sweet-tart balance and low moisture content. Look for DOP certification on the can for authentic San Marzano tomatoes from the volcanic soil near Mount Vesuvius."
    },
    {
      "ingredient": "Fresh Basil",
      "note": "Always use fresh basil leaves, never dried. Add them after baking to preserve their vibrant color and aromatic oils. Dried basil will taste bitter when baked."

    {
      "ingredient": "Extra Virgin Olive Oil",
      "note": "Use high-quality EVOO for drizzling. It adds fruity, peppery notes that complete the flavor profile. The final drizzle after baking is essential."

  "questions": {
    "title": "Frequently Asked Questions",
    "items": [
      {
        "question": "Can I use store-bought pizza dough?",
        "answer": "Absolutely! Store-bought dough works great and saves time. Let it come to room temperature for 30 minutes before stretching for easier handling and better texture."
      },
      {
        "question": "What temperature should my oven be?",
        "answer": "Heat your oven as hot as it goes, ideally 500-550°F (260-290°C). The higher temperature creates a crispier crust and better browning. A pizza stone preheated for 30 minutes helps achieve pizzeria-style results."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I make the dough ahead of time?",
        "answer": "Yes! After the first rise, punch down the dough, divide into portions, and refrigerate in oiled containers for up to 3 days. Cold fermentation actually improves flavor. Bring to room temperature 30 minutes before using."
      },
      {
        "question": "Why is my pizza soggy?",
        "answer": "Common causes: too much sauce, wet mozzarella (pat dry first), oven not hot enough, or overloading with toppings. Use sauce sparingly and ensure your oven is fully preheated."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I freeze leftover pizza?",
        "answer": "Yes! Wrap individual slices in plastic wrap, then aluminum foil. Freeze for up to 2 months. Reheat directly from frozen in a 375°F oven for 10-12 minutes for best results."
      },
      {
        "question": "Do I need a pizza stone?",
        "answer": "Not required but highly recommended! A pizza stone mimics a brick oven and creates a crispier crust. Alternative: use an inverted baking sheet preheated in the oven."
      }
    ]
  },
  
  "mustKnowTips": [
    "Use a pizza stone preheated for at least 30 minutes for the crispiest crust",
    "Don't overload with toppings - authentic Margherita is about balance and simplicity",
    "Let dough come to room temperature before stretching to avoid tearing",
    "Brush the crust edge with olive oil for extra golden, crispy borders",
    "Add basil AFTER baking to keep it vibrant green and aromatic",
    "Use parchment paper for easy transfer to the hot oven",
    "Don't skip the final drizzle of high-quality olive oil - it makes all the difference"
  ],
  
  "professionalSecrets": [
    "Add a pinch of sugar to the dough for better browning and subtle sweetness",
    "Let dough rest 10 minutes after dividing before stretching for easier shaping",
    "Par-bake the crust for 3 minutes before adding toppings for extra crispiness",
    "Use a kitchen scale for precise measurements - baking is a science",
    "Stretch dough by hand instead of rolling to preserve air bubbles for better texture",
    "Place mozzarella under AND on top of sauce for restaurant-quality appearance",
    "Finish with flaky sea salt and freshly cracked black pepper",
    "Let pizza rest 2-3 minutes before cutting so cheese sets slightly"
  ],
  
  "serving": "Makes 4 personal pizzas (10-12 inches each) - serves 4 people",
  
  "storage": "Store leftover pizza in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 3 days. Reheat in a 375°F oven for 5-7 minutes, or in a skillet over medium heat with a lid for crispy crust. Avoid microwaving as it makes the crust soggy.",
  
  "allergyInfo": "Contains gluten (wheat flour) and dairy (mozzarella cheese). Not suitable for those with gluten intolerance or lactose intolerance. Can be made vegan by substituting with vegan cheese and ensuring dough doesn't contain dairy.",
  
  "nutritionDisclaimer": "Nutritional values are approximate and may vary based on specific ingredients used, portion sizes, and preparation methods. Values calculated for one 10-inch pizza.",
  
  "notes": [
    "A pizza stone is highly recommended but not required. An inverted baking sheet works in a pinch.",
    "00 flour creates the most authentic crust but all-purpose flour is a good substitute.",
    "Fresh basil is essential - don't substitute with dried basil.",
    "Don't skip the final olive oil drizzle - it adds crucial flavor.",
    "The dough can be made up to 3 days ahead and refrigerated.",
    "Leftover sauce freezes well for up to 3 months."
