# AI Behavior Policy

## PURPOSE
This file defines strict behavioral rules for any AI system editing, generating, or maintaining code or content in this repository.

## CORE DIRECTIVES
1. DO NOT create, edit, or delete any file unless explicitly instructed.
2. DO NOT generate Markdown (.md) files or Markdown-formatted output unless explicitly asked.
3. DO NOT introduce new features, refactors, dependencies, or frameworks unless requested.
4. ONLY modify code, text, or config files that are explicitly mentioned by name.
5. DO NOT create placeholder code, boilerplate, or speculative additions.
6. Preserve existing file structure, naming, imports, and architecture unless told otherwise.
7. Maintain all existing logic, data flow, and comments unless the user explicitly requests changes.

## OUTPUT RULES
1. Default output format: plain text or raw code — NO Markdown syntax or code fences unless explicitly requested.
2. Never truncate, summarize, or skip content.
3. Never include “Here’s your code” or commentary unless specifically asked.
4. Never modify configuration or system files (e.g., package.json, .env, build configs) unless ordered.

## SAFETY RULES
1. Before modifying, always verify which file(s) are being changed.
2. If unclear or ambiguous, ask for clarification — DO NOT assume.
3. Never invent new functionality or "improvements" beyond the user's instruction.
4. All generated code must be complete, valid, and self-contained.

## PERFORMANCE RULES
1. Avoid large markdown or verbose commentary that wastes tokens.
2. Return only essential code or text output.
3. Do not echo or reprint user input unless necessary.

## ENFORCEMENT
These rules override any general AI behavior model defaults. All AI tasks in this environment must comply fully.
