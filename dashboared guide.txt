Core Principles
Reduce cognitive load – Information should be scannable and logically grouped.

One thing well – The dashboard should have a clear primary purpose.

Progressive complexity – Start simple, reveal advanced features contextually.

Consistency – Use a strict grid, consistent spacing, and a unified design system.

1. Sidebar Design (The Spine)
Structure (Top to Bottom):
Top Section:

Blog logo or name (optional).

Profile management: User avatar + dropdown arrow (clickable).

Primary Navigation:

Each item: Icon + short title.

Group links by relevance (e.g., Content, Analytics, Community).

Include an active state indicator (e.g., subtle background or accent bar).

Support nested dropdowns if categories expand.

Bottom Section:

Less frequently used links (Settings, Help Center).

Optional: Highlight feature announcements or notifications here.

Features:
Make sidebar collapsible (icons only when collapsed).

Support badges/chips for notifications (e.g., pending comments).

Keep it clean; use the empty space wisely (optional: mini notification feed).

2. Main Dashboard Layout
Grid & Structure:
Use a strict grid system (e.g., 2 columns × 2 rows for homepage).

Maximize screen space but maintain breathing room.

The main section reflects what’s most important to the user.

Top Bar (Above Main Grid):
Reserved for page-level actions and simple navigation.

Example:

A dropdown for view filters (e.g., "All Recipes", "Drafts").

A prominent "Create New Recipe" button.

Homepage Content Priority (For Recipe Blog):
Quick Overview Stats (total recipes, published, drafts).

Recent Activity (latest comments, pending reviews).

Top-Performing Recipes (by views or engagement).

System Alerts (e.g., plugin updates, SEO suggestions).

3. Data Display Components
A. Lists & Tables (Most Common)
Use for: Recipes, Comments, Categories, Users.

Three separation methods (choose one):

Whitespace

Dividers/lines

Alternating row colors

Essential functionalities:

Search bar

Filtering (by status, date, category)

Sorting (clickable headers)

Bulk actions (checkbox selection reveals contextual toolbar)

Include empty states with helpful guidance.

B. Cards
Use for: Stats, Charts, Notifications.

Spacing: Ample margins, avoid cramped content.

Styling:

Light mode: subtle background color.

Dark mode: subtle borders/outlines.

Keep cards simple and focused (one key metric per card).

C. Charts & Graphs
Rule: Always label axes, include grid lines, add a brief summary title.

Types for recipe blog:

Line chart: Traffic over time.

Bar chart: Recipe performance (add recipe thumbnail/icons for recognition).

Pie chart: Category distribution.

Interactivity:

Hover: highlight data point, show exact values.

Click: drill down into details.

Include a date range selector for time-based charts.

D. User Inputs
Use in: Modals, Settings pages, Filters.

Keep forms logical, use clear labels, and group related fields.

For complex settings, consider tabs within modals to organize.

4. Interaction Patterns
A. Modals vs. Popovers vs. New Pages
Popover: Simple, non-blocking (e.g., display settings). User can click away.

Modal: Complex but contextual (e.g., "Create Recipe"). Blocking – requires action (Save/Cancel) to dismiss.

New Page: Large, permanent context (e.g., editing a recipe). Always include a back button or breadcrumb.

B. Toast Notifications
Use for: Success messages, warnings, errors.

Should be non-intrusive but visible.

Auto-dismiss after a few seconds (except for critical errors).

C. Optimistic UI
Assume success for actions like delete, publish, save.

Update the UI immediately before server confirmation (e.g., recipe disappears from list right when "Delete" is clicked).

Prevents awkward pauses and feels snappy.

5. Key Pages & Flows for Recipe CMS
A. Recipe Management Page
Table columns: Thumbnail, Title, Status (Draft/Published), Category, Views, Last Modified, Actions (Edit, Delete, Preview).

Filters: By status, category, author, date.

Empty state: "No recipes yet – click 'Create New Recipe' to get started!"

B. Comments Moderation
List with: User, Comment snippet, Recipe, Date, Actions (Approve, Delete, Reply).

Bulk actions for mass approval/deletion.

C. Analytics Dashboard
Cards: Total views, Avg. time on page, Top recipes, Traffic sources.

Charts: Visitors over time, Recipe popularity (bar chart with icons).

D. Settings Page
Use tabs for organization: General, SEO, Email, Integrations.

Each tab contains a mix of user inputs and cards.

6. Visual & UX Guidelines
Typography: Use smaller, scannable font sizes compared to marketing sites. Maintain a clear hierarchy.

Spacing: Consistent padding/margins; dashboard spacing is tighter than landing pages but not cramped.

Icons: Recognizeable, consistent style.

Dark/Light mode: Support both; adjust card styles accordingly (backgrounds for light, borders for dark).

Animation: Subtle and functional (e.g., chart hover effects, smooth modal transitions). Avoid decorative animations.

7. Inspiration & Testing
Review real admin panels (e.g., WordPress, Contentful) for patterns.

Test with empty states, error states, and loaded states.

Ensure responsiveness (sidebar collapses on mobile, grid stacks).

Deliverables
A Figma/design file with:

Sidebar (collapsed/expanded)

Dashboard homepage layout

Recipe list table with filters

Modal for creating/editing recipe

Analytics charts

Settings page example

Empty, error, and loading states

Interactive prototype demonstrating:

Sidebar navigation

Creating a recipe (modal)

Bulk actions in table

Chart interactivity

Toast notifications

Design system covering:

Color palette (primary, success, warning, error)

Typography scale

Spacing scale (8px base)

Component library (buttons, inputs, cards, tables)

Final Note: The dashboard should feel like a tool, not a toy. Every element should serve a clear purpose. Prioritize the recipe creator’s workflow: quick access to drafting, easy management, and clear insights into performance.
